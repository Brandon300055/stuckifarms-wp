        <p class="rbto-30 text-grey-f707">Inspired by the Bungalow Courts built along the West Coast in the early 1900s, these quaint homes were grouped around common courtyards.  Several areas in Stucki Farms present unique opportunities to create clusters of these Bungalows and Casitas gathered around a series of landscaped common areas where there is always the opportunity to stop and visit or simply say “hello”.</p>
